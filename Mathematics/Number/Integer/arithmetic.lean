Module      : Arithmetic.
Description : Fundamental arithmetic on ℤ
Maintainer  : Robert Culling <rhsculling@pm.com>

  ℤ, along with negation, +, * were constructed in:

    Mathematics.Number.Integer.construction

  This module proves basic theorems in the arithmetic
  of the integers. Once these a proved, one should not
  need to refer to the implementation details of ℤ
  as a quotient of ℕ × ℕ.
